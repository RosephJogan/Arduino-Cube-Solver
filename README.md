Change lines 11 - 17 at your discretion.
For how to build, watch my YouTube demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFL7_Q0V6MY.
A servo should be controlling the arm that grabs the cube, and a stepper motor should be turning the bottom face.
The servo should be connected to pin 7 of the Arduino.

IMPORTANT:
Change the OneStep() function and stepper pin definitions according to what kind of stepper motor you have.
I used a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor, with a ULN2003 driver.

You should be set! For questions or help, email me at seanthegreat29@gmail.com
